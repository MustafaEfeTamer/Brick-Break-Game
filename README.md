### The Purpose of The Game : 
The player will try to break the bricks on the OLED screen by bouncing a ball using a physical paddle control device. The paddle will be controlled with a potentiometer. The OLED display shows the players the game area. At the top are the bricks, at the bottom is the paddle controlled by the player, and a bouncing ball. The player's goal is to break the bricks at the top using the ball. The ball bounces upward using the paddle controlled by the player. When the ball hits the bricks, the brick disappears, and the player earns "1" point. This score should be displayed on a 7-segment display. When the ball hits the paddle or walls, its direction changes. The right and left sides of the screen are also considered walls. If a level ends successfully, the next level starts with the ball's speed 20% higher than its previous speed. Our overall score and number of lives are not reset in the next level. When a brick is broken, there is a 10% chance that a life object will appear inside it. If the player collects it with the paddle, the number of lives increases by 1. The game ends when our lives are exhausted by the ball falling to the bottom.
